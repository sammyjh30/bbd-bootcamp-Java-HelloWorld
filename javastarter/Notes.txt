<Interface vs Class>
Interfaces can't have members

eg. Create a Person, can't have a members for the name

e.g a Container can contain liquad. So a Cup and a Pan have nothing in similarity except that ehy are containers.
So an interface Container would have a get volume for that particular instance.
Cup vs Pan vs Box -> volume would be calculated differently.


<Multiple Inheritance>

Interface VolumeContainer

Abstract Class CylinderContainer    &   Abstract Class CubeContainer

Box made of mesh -> is it cubicVolumeContainer? yes

Can inherit, but would change the interface of the getVolume (e.g water), 
so if nothing specified for the liquad, assume wwater.

<Functional interfaces>
Lambas, anonymous functions,(clovers?)
Generics:
<T, R> two types/classes, can transform (e.g. web request to result)



Java cannot extend the string type.

<Variables>
Java has direct(primitive) variables (values) and reference variables(pointers).
Java has automatic conversion (boxing and unboxing), which will automatically create a reference.

e.g.
int a=0; => primitive
Integer a Int = 1; => reference

canot make a list of int, only of Integer.



<Instance variables>
e.g. Person class {name and surname}, every person will have a name and a surname (these are instances)

Static variable, every instance doesn't have a copy, class has a copy

<Local variables>
final variable = constant
e.g. in a method, can only see local variables, and class/instance methods that have access to.

<Method>
Difference between method and function?
Methods need to be in a class.
In java, everything is a method, as everything needs to be in a class.


<Overload Method>
Method signature has 3 parts: parameter types, name and return type
Overload method only has one thing that is the same (name)

<Constructors>
The detail of how to construct these objects

If you don't put a constructor, Java implicitly creates a public one that can be accessed

Constructor always has the same name as the classs name.

<Modifiers>
<Access Modifiers>
3access modifiers in Java: public, protected and private
4 access levels: public, protected (everything except the world can see it), default and private.

final method cannot be overridden, final class cannot be inherited.


<Imports>
Import vs Static
Import imports classes, nothing specific from that class (e.g. Class.List)
Static allows public static references to be accessible (many people dislike)

<Abstract Class>
A class that cannot be instantiated. 
A class that has at least one abstract method can be a abstract class or an interface.


<Declaration vs Assignment>
Declaration sets a piece of memory according to that type.
Declaration: String variable1;
Declaraction AND Assignment: String variable2 = "Test";

<Boolean Operations>
== and a.equals(b) is not the same.
For strings .equals checks every character
== checks where in memory

<Immutable>
You're not gonna change the variable, you're gonna change where it
points to.

<Streams>
Second example not a  good example of code
Wouldn't compile because list could be reassignable

IntStream.range(1, 20).forEach(i -> values.add(new Task("Task" + random.nextInt(10), random.nextInt(10))));
|                    | |                   |__________________________________________________________| |     
|                    | |                             construct a new Task with info ints                |
|____________________| |________________________________________________________________________________|
    numbers 1 to 19                                    Adding to list


<Reduce>
e.g.
public static void main(String[] args) {
    IntStream s = IntStream.range(i:1, i1: 1000)
            .map(i -> new Random().nextInt(i: 100))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

    int evenSum = s.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 = 0).mapToInt(i->i).sum();
    int addSum = s.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 = 1).mapToInt(i->i).sum();

    int altEvenSum = s.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 = 0).mapToInt(i->i).reduce(i: 0, (a,b)-> a+b);
                                                                            result of accumilator must be the same type
Avoid throuwing exceptions in lamdas
